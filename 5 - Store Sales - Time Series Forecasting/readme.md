Store Sales é um projeto baseado no Kaggle em que você pode ver os notebooks de outros participantes. 

Para que você entenda melhor a previsão de séries temporais, tente aplicar suas habilidades ao conjunto de dados da Bolsa de Valores e use o Facebook Prophet para treinar um modelo de previsão de séries temporais univariadas. 


About this Competition
In this competition, you will predict sales for the thousands of product families sold at Favorita stores located in Ecuador. The training data includes dates, store and product information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the sales numbers. Additional files include supplementary information that may be useful in building your models.

The training data, comprising time series of features store_nbr, family, and onpromotion as well as the target sales.
store_nbr identifies the store at which the products are sold.
family identifies the type of product sold.
sales gives the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date. Fractional values are possible since products can be sold in fractional units (1.5 kg of cheese, for instance, as opposed to 1 bag of chips).
onpromotion gives the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store at a given date.
