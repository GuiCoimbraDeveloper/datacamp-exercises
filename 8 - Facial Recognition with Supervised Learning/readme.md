Facial Recognition with Supervised Learning
Explore facial recognition with ML by distinguishing Arnold Schwarzenegger from others using Python and scikit-learn.

Descrição do Projeto
Tackle the challenge of distinguishing images of Arnold Schwarzenegger from others using a dataset of faces and gain insights into the principles of facial recognition technology. This project guides you through building a machine learning pipeline and optimizing and evaluating models in Python and scikit-learn.

Leverage machine learning to enhance the security of influential figures by distinguishing Arnold Schwarzenegger from others.

Construct machine learning pipelines for three classification models. Store these initialized models in a dictionary named models.
Determine the best performing model based on cross-validation scores. Save the model's name as best_model_name, its parameters as best_model_info, and its cross-validation score as best_model_cv_score.
Evaluate the selected model and store accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 on the test set.
Aim to achieve a minimum accuracy of 80% for at least one of the models. Save your best accuracy score as score.
As an optional step, use Matplotlib to create a confusion matrix visualization for the predictions made by your best model.
