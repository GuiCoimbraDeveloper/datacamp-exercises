Automate e-commerce processes with image classification.

Descrição do Projeto
Imagine revolutionizing the fashion and retail industry with cutting-edge AI: as data scientists, we have the opportunity to develop an innovative garment classification system. This project goes beyond mere categorization of clothing items; it's about creating a smarter, more efficient, and user-friendly shopping experience. Leveraging machine learning, specifically image classification, we can transform how consumers interact with fashion online, making it easier to find the perfect outfit among a vast array of choices. By joining this venture, you're not just coding algorithms; you're shaping the future of e-commerce and retail, blending technology with style, and opening up new realms of possibility in the rapidly evolving world of digital fashion.

Define a CNN classifier as a Sequential model with the following layers:
Convolution layer with 32 filters, kernel size 3 and stride 1, followed by a rectilinear unit (relu) activation.
Convolution layer with 16 filters, kernel size 3 and stride 1, followed by a rectilinear unit (relu) activation.
Flatten layer.
Dense layer with the appropriate number of units and activation function.
Train your CNN on the given train_images using a suitable optimizer.
Only run your training loop for a single epoch to keep the run time down.
Use accuracy as a metric, and an appropriate loss function.
Evaluate your CNN on the given test_images:
Calculate the accuracy of your trained classifier on the test_images, storing your answer in the variable test_accuracy.
The above instructions are what you will need to use to submit the project, but once you've passed the project, feel free to experiment with the model architecture and training arguments to achieve a better accuracy!
