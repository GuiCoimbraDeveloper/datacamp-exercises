Enhancing Transportation Safety through Traffic Sign Detection

Descrição do Projeto
Join this AI project aiming to improve automated driving by developing a system for detecting stop signs and traffic lights. With Keras's image recognition capabilities, you are working to refine how self-driving cars interpret and react to traffic signals, with the goal of enhancing safety and minimizing accidents.

Address the challenges faced in modern transportation systems using Keras.

Define and train an object detection model to identify traffic signs and lights. Save the training accuracy in a variable named accuracy.
Only run your training loop for 20 epochs due to the small size of the training data.
