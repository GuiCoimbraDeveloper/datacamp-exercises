Predict Energy Consumption
Use regression and machine learning models to predict daily power consumption based on temporal factors.

Descrição do Projeto
Explore the dynamics of daily power consumption and uncover patterns that influence usage based on temporal factors.

As a Data Scientist, you will use regression analysis to predict future consumption and provide actionable insights for optimizing energy usage.

Project Instructions
Predict daily power_consumption by experimenting with various supervised regression models trained on the training dataset.

Evaluate their performance on the test dataset by measuring their Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Save the lowest RMSE achieved on the test set as a numeric variable selected_rmse, which should not be greater than 450 kW.
Plot the power_consumption predictions and actual daily power_consumption for the test dataset and assess whether the predictions follow a similar trend as the original data.

Save your answer "Yes" or "No" as a string variable trend_similarity.
